# close-job-application

This is the application this repo is for:

There are two Python files in this repo. Both were written under Python 3.13, but I imagine they would work fine on a slightly older version of Python. I wrote `human.py` first, which solved the challenge in a relatively simple and effective way. The `chatgpt-4o.py` file is written by ChatGPT-4o, in which I had to help it a little bit to get the result. You can find that chat at https://chatgpt.com/share/67e1a2b2-1dec-8013-93f1-a11e530e9ed3.

In order to run either script, you will need to `pip install requests==2.32.3`. I've conveniently created a `requirements.txt` if you prefer `pip install -r requirements.txt`. I recommend doing this in a virtual env or isolated instance.

Then, you can just run `python human.py` or `python chatgpt-4o.py` to see the code work and results.
